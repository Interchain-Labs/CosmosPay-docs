# Introduction

## The basics

CosmosPay  aids businesses and consumers to settle transactions with blockchain technology by providing plugins for various CMS systems to help business owners accept cryptocurrencies in an easy and efficient way. Current supported CMS-systems are Woocommerce & Prestashop.

We are developing an Universal iFRAME plugin that will fit in any custom developing.

The payment plugin focuses on blockchains built with specific blockchain technology called [Cosmos](https://docs.cosmos.network/v0.46/intro/overview.html), and works with the [Keplr Wallet](https://www.keplr.app/) Browser Extension, and any other wallet that supports the accepted cryptocurrencies.

To start using CosmosPay in your store, youâ€™ll need to set up a digital wallet (Keplr Wallet), and install the Plugin for your store: **Cosmos Pay**.
